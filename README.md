# Tech test
Note: Floating Action Button (FAB) is used as the refresh button. It is located at the bottom right of the screen


# Improvement plans

- Write some unit tests
- Improve UI/UX design
- Use Jetpack compose instead of XML
- Write UI tests for the refresh feature to test whether the values displayed are as expected.
